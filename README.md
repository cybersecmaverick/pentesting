# Pentesting Zone


This repository contains a collection of scripts, cheatsheets, and tools that I have created or been inspired by for use in my early journey as a Penetration Tester. 
The scripts will cover a variety of languages, including Python, Bash, and PowerShell, and are designed to help new comers to the field learn common attacks and techniques or make common tasks easier and more efficient.

Join me on my journey into the exciting world of pentesting!
